Let's talk SOLID principles!

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
Ever seen a God class? SRP reminds us that a class should have only one reason to change. In Java, this often means breaking down large classes into smaller, focused ones, improving readability and testing.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP): 
Imagine extending functionality without modifying existing code. OCP, often achieved in Java through interfaces and abstract classes, allows us to add new features seamlessly, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
This principle is key for proper inheritance. If B is a subtype of A, then objects of A should be replaceable with objects of B without altering the correctness of the program. Essential for robust polymorphism in Java!

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): 
Instead of one large, "fat" interface, ISP suggests breaking them into smaller, client-specific interfaces. This prevents Java classes from implementing methods they don't need, leading to cleaner code and better API design.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. In Java, this is heavily supported by Dependency Injection frameworks like Spring, promoting loose coupling and testability.
